With the graduation of four fantastic Wiseman lab members (Val, Jaleh, Jessica, and Lara), we are at the end of an era. The last group to remember the lab in MEM and the transition to MB, and all the outstanding science they accomplished along the way. I couldn't be more proud of this group, and I can't wait to see what fantastic things they will accomplish next! Congrats!
