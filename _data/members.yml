Mitochondria are key, for you and me, and I love to mess with them and see. Sometimes they’re long, sometimes they’re stout, and sometimes they’re angry and just kind of shout. It’s my hope, with my trusty ‘scope, to map these changes as mitochondria cope. The pictures are gorgeous, and sometimes glorious, and I’ll continue to take them until I’m victorious.

The sterile environment, once a sanctuary of science, now harbors secrets that defy the laws of nature that Keishla seeks to uncover. Keishla's journey into the unknown began long before Scripps, for she emerged from the shadows of the University of Puerto Rico, Mayagüez, where she earned a bachelor degree in Industrial Biotechnology. The tendrils of her academic pursuit reached far and wide, weaving through the sinister tapestry of labs at the SSRL SLAC National Accelerator and Abbvie, each contributing a chapter to her quest.

  description: "I tell ya, folks, I'm in the academic rat race, but I get no respect! I'm over here, trying to unravel the mysteries of proteins like they're some kind of cosmic puzzle, and all I get is blank stares and mutterings of "good luck with that" from my peers. Growing up, I was all about the X-Men, you know? Mutations, superpowers, the whole shebang! So, naturally, I figured genetics and biotech were my bag. Went through high school and undergrad in India, soaking up everything I could about DNA and biotechnology like a sponge in a lab coat. Then, I land myself in Pennsylvania State University, diving headfirst into a Professional Masters program in Biotechnology. And let me tell ya, that was my first real taste of the big leagues. Drug discovery, biotech industry... it was like swimming with sharks in a sea of pipettes. After I graduated, I hightailed it to San Francisco faster than you can say "PCR". Worked at this startup, tinkering away with proteins like SARM1, trying to figure out how they're making axons go haywire in neurological disorders. Hit-to-lead campaigns, driving drugs to the clinic... it was like playing biochemistry chess with a side of lab-coated swagger! But hey, I ain't done yet! Now, I'm back in the academic trenches at Scripps Research, ready to bridge the gap between academia and industry. Structural biology, biochemistry, you name it – I'm on a mission to answer the big questions, the ones that could maybe, just maybe, change lives down the road. When I'm not sciencing it up in the lab, you'll find me kickin' back at the movies, catching waves by the beach, or chowing down on some of the meanest baja fish tacos this side of the border.
