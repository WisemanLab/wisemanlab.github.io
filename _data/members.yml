  description: "Karen Hughes has been a Lab Admin Coordinator with Scripps Research for over eight years.  Most of her responsibility is to support the lab by completing the administrative work on grant applications, order supplies and equipment when tasked and to provide any other necessary support to the lab.  Her background has been working in government and commercial settings providing support in the creation of grant submissions for over thirty years.  She also has a hazmat background providing support by maintaining a database used to classify hazardous products based on the specifications stated in the material safety data sheets (MSDS).  Karen brings her beloved 10 year old miniature dachshund office mate, Cooper, to work with her everyday and he makes sure that no one interrupts her work flow.  When Karen isn’t at work she is generally found out on a hiking trail or clogging with her fellow dance friends.


  Make no mistake about it. Karen runs the show. Anything you need, she gets it done... provided you can get by Cooper."
