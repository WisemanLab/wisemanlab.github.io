I'm over here, trying to unravel the mysteries of proteins like they're some kind of cosmic puzzle, and all I get is blank stares and mutterings of 'good luck with that' from my peers. Growing up, I was all about the X-Men, you know? Mutations, superpowers, the whole shebang! So, naturally, I figured genetics and biotech were my bag. Went through high school and undergrad in India, soaking up everything I could about DNA and biotechnology like a sponge in a lab coat. Then, I land myself in Pennsylvania State University, diving headfirst into a Professional Masters program in Biotechnology. And let me tell ya, that was my first real taste of the big leagues. Drug discovery, biotech industry... it was like swimming with sharks in a sea of pipettes. After I graduated, I hightailed it to San Francisco faster than you can say 'PCR'. Worked at this startup, tinkering away with proteins like SARM1, trying to figure out how they're making axons go haywire in neurological disorders. Hit-to-lead campaigns, driving drugs to the clinic... it was like playing biochemistry chess with a side of lab-coated swagger! But hey, I ain't done yet! Now, I'm back in the academic trenches at Scripps Research, ready to bridge the gap between academia and industry. Structural biology, biochemistry, you name it – I'm on a mission to answer the big questions, the ones that could maybe, just maybe, change lives down the road. When I'm not sciencing it up in the lab, you'll find me kickin' back at the movies, catching waves by the beach, or chowing down on some of the meanest baja fish tacos this side of the border.
