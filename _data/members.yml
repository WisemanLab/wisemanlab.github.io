  description: "Karen Hughes has been a Lab Admin Coordinator with Scripps Research for over eight years.  Most of her responsibility is to support the lab by completing the administrative work on grant applications, order supplies and equipment when tasked and to provide any other necessary support to the lab.  Her background has been working in government and commercial settings providing support in the creation of grant submissions for over thirty years.  She also has a hazmat background providing support by maintaining a database used to classify hazardous products based on the specifications stated in the material safety data sheets (MSDS).  Karen brings her beloved 10 year old miniature dachshund office mate, Cooper, to work with her everyday and he makes sure that no one interrupts her work flow.  When Karen isn’t at work she is generally found out on a hiking trail or clogging with her fellow dance friends.


  Make no mistake about it. Karen runs the show. Anything you need, she gets it done... provided you can get by Cooper."

  description: "My name is Sam, so Sam I am, and I’m in the Grotjahn and Wiseman fam. I’m from the Alamo, so all you know, I came to Scripps to learn and grow. Mitochondria are key, for you and me, and I love to mess with them and see. Sometimes they’re long, sometimes they’re stout, and sometimes they’re angry and just kind of shout. It’s my hope, with my trusty ‘scope, to map these changes as mitochondria cope. The pictures are gorgeous, and sometimes glorious, and I’ll continue to take them until I’m victorious. Give me some time, and you will find, the continued development of my mind. I’m excited to be here, but I’ll never show it, but if you talk with me, you’ll most certainly know it.


  Sam is supported by a predoctoral fellowship from [NSF](https://www.nsf.gov/), although she would really want a Dr. Seuss fellowship."
